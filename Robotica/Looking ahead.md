# Looking ahead

In 1939, when I was 19 years old, I began to write a series of science ﬁction stories about robots. At the time, the word *robot* had been in existence for only 18 years; Karel Capek’s play, *R.U.R.*, in which the word had been coined, having been performed for the ﬁrst time in Europe in 1921. The concept, however, that of machines that could perform tasks with the apparent “intelligence” of human beings, had been in existence for thousands of years.

Through all those years, however, robots in myth, legend, and literature had been designed only to point a moral. Generally, they were treated as examples of overweening pride on the part of the human designer; an effort to accomplish something that was reserved to God alone. And, inevitably, this overweening pride was overtaken by Nemesis (as it always is in morality tales), so that the designer was destroyed, usually by that which he had created.

I grew tired of these myriad-told tales, and decided I would tell of robots that were carefully designed to perform certain tasks, but with *safeguards built in*; robots that might conceivably be dangerous, as any machine might be, but no more so.

In telling these tales, I worked out, perforce, certain rules of conduct that guided the robots; rules that I dealt with in a more and more reﬁned manner over the next 44 years (my most recent robot novel, *The Robots of Dawn*, was published in October, 1983). These rules were ﬁrst put into words in a story called “Runaround,” which appeared in the March, 1942, issue of *Astounding Science Fiction*.

In that issue, on page 100, one of my characters says, “Now, look, let’s start with the three fundamental Rules of Robotics...” and he proceeds to recite them. (In later stories, I took to referring to them as “the Three Laws of Robotics” and other people generally say “Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics.”)

I am carefully speciﬁc about this point because that line on that page in that story was, as far as I know, the very ﬁrst time and place that the word *robotics* had ever appeared in print.

I did not deliberately make up the word. Since

*physics*

and most of its subdivisions routinely have the “-ics” suffix, I assumed that “robotics” was the proper scientiﬁc term for the systematic study of robots, of their construction, maintenance, and behavior, and that it was used as such. It was only decades later that I became aware of the fact that the word was in no dictionary, general or scientiﬁc, and that I had coined it.

Possibly every person has a chance at good fortune in his life, but there can’t be very many people who have had the incredible luck to live to see their fantasies begin to turn into reality.

I think sadly, for instance, of a good friend of mine who did not. He was Willy Ley who, for all his adult life was wedded to rocketry and to the dream of reaching the moon; who in his early twenties helped found rocket research in Germany; who, year after year wrote popular books on the subject; who, in 1969, was preparing to witness the launch of the ﬁrst rocket intended to land on the moon; and who then died six weeks before that launch took place.

Such a tragedy did not overtake me. I lived to see the transistor invented, and solid-state devices undergo rapid development until the microchip became a reality. I lived to see Joseph Engelberger (with his interest sparked by my stories, actually) found Unimation, Inc., and then keep it going, with determination and foresight, until it actually constructed and installed industrial robots and grew enormously proﬁtable. His devices were not quite the humanoid robots of my stories, but in many respects they were far more sophisticated than anything I had ever been equipped to imagine. Nor is there any doubt that the development of robots more like mine, with the capacities to see and to talk, for instance, are very far off.

I lived to see my Three Laws of Robotics taken seriously and routinely referred to in articles on robotics, written by real roboticists, as in a couple of cases in this volume. I lived to see them referred to familiarly, even in the popular press, and identiﬁed with my name, so that I can see I have secured for myself (all unknowingly, I must admit) a secure footnote in the history of science.

I even lived to see myself regarded with a certain amount of esteem by legitimate people in the ﬁeld of robotics, as a kind of grandfather of them all, even though, in actual fact, I am merely a chemist by training and a science-ﬁction writer by choice — and know virtually nothing about the nuts and bolts of robotics; or of computers, for that matter.

But even after I thought I had grown accustomed to all of this, and had ceased marveling over this amazing turn of the wheel of fortune, and was certain that there was nothing left in this situation that had the capacity to surprise me, I found I was wrong.

Let me explain...

In 1950 nine of my stories of robots were put together into a volume entitled *I, Robot* (the volume, as it happens, that was to inspire Mr. Engelberger). On the page before the table of contents, there are inscribed, in lonely splendor *The Three Laws of Robotics*: 

1. *A robot may not injure a human being. or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.*
2. *A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conﬂict with the First Law.*
3. *A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conﬂict with the First or Second Law.*

And underneath, I give my source. It is *Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.*

Unbelievable. Never, until it actually happened, did I ever believe that I would really live to see robots, really live to see my three laws quoted everywhere. And certainly I never actually believed that I would ever really live to see the ﬁrst edition of that handbook published.

To be sure, it is *Handbook of Industrial Robotics*, for that is where the emphasis is now, in the early days of robotics — but I am certain that, with the development of robots for the office and the home, future editions will need the more general title. I also feel that so rapidly does the ﬁeld develop, there will be new editions at short intervals. And if there are new editions every 15 months on the average, we will have the ﬁfty-sixth edition in 2058 A.D.

But matters don’t stop here. Having foreseen so much, let me look still further into the future. I see robots rapidly growing incredibly more complex, versatile, and useful than they are now. I see them taking over all work that is too simple, too repetitive, too stultifying for the human brain to be subjected to. I see robots leaving human beings free to develop creativity, and I see humanity astonished at ﬁnding that almost everyone can be creative in one way or another. (Just as it turned out, astonishingly, once public education became a matter of course, that reading and writing was not an elite activity but could be engaged in by almost everyone.)

I see the world, and the human outposts on other worlds and in space, ﬁlled with cousin-intelligences of two entirely different types. I see silicon-intelligence (robots) that can manipulate numbers with incredible speed and precision and that can perform operations tirelessly and with perfect reproducibility; and I see carbon-intelligence (human beings) that can apply intuition, insight, and imagination to the solution of problems on the basis of what would seem insufficient data to a robot. I see the former building the foundations of a new, and unimaginably better society than any we have ever experienced; and I see the latter building the superstructure, with a creative fantasy we dare not picture now.

I see the two together advancing far more rapidly than either could alone. And though this, alas, I will not live to see, I am conﬁdent our children and grandchildren will, and that future editions of this handbook will detail the process.
